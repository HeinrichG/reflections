When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- On shared projects/when collaborating with other developers
- When using different devices for development => private and work machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Might lead to conflicts when collaborating

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- fork: Clones a repository from a nother user/project to your repositories. Only on GitHub.
- Clone: Same as fork, but only if you don't want to clone only on GitHub. Use to Clone a repository from GitHub to local or from local to local
- branch: Only used within a repository to create a new "path" of commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- Able to do fast-forward merges
