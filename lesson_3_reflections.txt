When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- On shared projects/when collaborating with other developers
- When using different devices for development => private and work machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Might lead to conflicts when collaborating
